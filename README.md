#  TinyApp Project 

TinyApp is a full stack web application, built with node and express that allows users to shorten URLs.

Finally submitting this project after managing to find time during the week #5 period, (remote week).

Attempted to address missing features and the errors pointed out with the login/register module , as well as errors with deletions when user submitted urls.

# Instructions on How to use the App.

1. User registers from the main window, with a unique username and password
2. User then "logs in" with the previously entered "username" and password.
3. User is then able to "add" a new LONG URL  (eg. http://somewhere.com) , and the system will generate a "tiny" url for that supplied URL.

+ Eg. user enters   http://www.google.com   &&  the system will return a SHORTURL - 6 characters long.  You can visit the longUrl by clicking on the SHORTURL that was generated.

+ Note: Users can change/delete the LongUrl at any point in time from the menu. Users can also logout from the system at any point in time.
