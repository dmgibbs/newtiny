#  TinyApp Project 

TinyApp is a full stack web application, built with node and express that allows users to shorten URLs.

Final Product.

This project is only partially complete.  Many of the major components are missing. Had issues with pulling out the registration onto a new page ; the implementation of which broke some views after changing the DB structure. This was over the weekend. Could not progress as I would have preferred. Spent too much time solving what may have been minor issues rather than on the major milestones. Attempted to implement bcrypt, but the passwords hash kept failing; resulting in the break of the logic so it was removed.

After attempting to implement the Database modification, the routine to display the short Urls for specific users stopped working.. 

Simply mismanaged my time. It wasnt for not trying. Took too long to understand important things.

Later versions would have included more of the functional requirements done, along with code refactoring and my modules in external files,but its already a late submission at 5am as I write this.
